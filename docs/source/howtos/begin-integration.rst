How to begin integration
========================

All the commands presented in this BLE API require PTLS session.
You can find a guide to achieve that on :doc:`establish-ptls-session` page.
As security library we recommend using:

- C language `MbedTLS <https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbedtls>`_,
- iOS **CryptoSwift** and native Apple framework **Security** for keys management,
- Java **javax.crypto** and **java.security**.
